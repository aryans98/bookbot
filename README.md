# bookbot
- BookBot is my first git project!
- It's a Python program that can analyze an entire book’s text and print out an interesting statistical report such as a report which tells how many times all the alphabets (A-Z) were used in the entire book’s text.<img width="640" alt="book-bot" src="https://github.com/aryans98/bookbot/assets/84920015/511fec38-d149-4f69-9986-6a749e71ad09">
